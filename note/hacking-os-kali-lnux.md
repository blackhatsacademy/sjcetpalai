### Should I Use Kali Linux?
#### What’s Different About Kali Linux?

Kali Linux is specifically geared to meet the requirements of professional penetration testing and security auditing. 
To achieve this, several core changes have been implemented in Kali Linux which reflect these needs:
Network services disabled by default: Kali Linux contains systemd hooks that disable network services by default. 
These hooks allow us to install various services on Kali Linux, while ensuring that our distribution remains secure by default,
no matter what packages are installed. Additional services such as Bluetooth are also blacklisted by default.
Custom Linux kernel: Kali Linux uses an upstream kernel, patched for wireless injection.
A minimal and trusted set of repositories: given the aims and goals of Kali Linux, 
maintaining the integrity of the system as a whole is absolutely key. With that goal in mind, the set of upstream software 
sources which Kali uses is kept to an absolute minimum. Many new Kali users are tempted to add additional repositories to their 
sources.list, but doing so runs a very serious risk of breaking your Kali Linux installation.

# Kali Linux Features


### What is Kali Linux, and what is a Penetration Testing Distribution?

* What is a penetration testing distribution?
      As legend tells it, years ago there was a penetration test in an isolated environment where the assessment
      team was not able to bring in any computers or have network access in or out of the target environment.
      In order to do the work, the first penetration testing distribution was born. It was a bootable Live CD 
      configured with various tools needed to do the work, and after the assessment was completed the Live CD 
      was shared online and became very popular.

##### Kali Linux has a direct lineage from this original distribution, running on through BackTrack Linux, and now is Kali Linux.

### What are the makings of a great penetration testing distribution?
*    What a penetration testing distribution is judged on has changed over the years.
*    Originally it was just how many tools did it hold. Then it was did it have package management
*    how often were they updated? As we have matured, so has the features that we need to provide.
*    The true indication of a great Penetration Testing distribution is the selection of useful 
*    relevant features that it offers security professionals. What kind of features are we talking about?
*    We’re happy you asked! We’ve made a short list of some of these Kali Linux features, and linked them to their respective sources.
